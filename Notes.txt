TODO:
- Write code for training and testing
- Write code for evaluating model

- All the stuff needed to create an app or smth that I will figure out later

IN PROGRESS:
- Write code for data processing
    --> Figure out datasets/generators
    --> Create data and figure out how to process it

DONE:
- Figure out model architecture

Bugaboos:
- Varying sample rates (upsampling/downsampling not great)
- Time information
    - Training sequentially
    - Time information encaptured within the 20 millisecond frame lost with FFT
        --> Maybe use a spectrogram if needed
- Different amplitude audio
    --> If I scale how do I scale back to reform the audio?
        --> I guess I can create a shit ton of scaler objects and just save them to a list
            but that is insanely inefficient
        --> Going to just try logarithms for now, might come back to this later

Notes:
- Generally need 20 milliseconds to pronounce a phonetic

Acrynoyms:
- 'dev' - code used for development, not needed for use
- 'hyp' - reference indicating where hyperparameters are

Model version information:
- Version 1 --> preliminary version created just from testing scripts
